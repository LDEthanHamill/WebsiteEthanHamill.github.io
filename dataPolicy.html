        <h1>Data Policy</h1>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        The Data Controller is Ethan Hamill. You can contact me using any contact details you hold for me, or using the contact form below.<br>
        This policy was last updated on <b>Wednesday, 23 October 2019.</b>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Data I collect</h3>
        I collect names, emails + email addresses + Phone & Mobile Numbers + Occasionally postial/residential addresses. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <h3>What I use your data for</h3>
        Your data is used to allow me to perform work for you and communicate with you and others about that work.<br>
        The lawful basis of the data collection is the contract or contracts I have with you, or the work I need to do to prepare <br>
        any quotes or estimates. I will only use and collect postal addresses for invoicing, contracting and preparing estimates.<br>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Who I share your data with</h3>
        I share your data with other organisations as a direct part of providing you with my services. I don't use your contact <br>
        information for marketing or share it with other third parties without asking.<br>
        Some of the organisations I share your data with include Google, Dropbox, Apple, Squarespace and my accountant. Some of these<br>
        organisations are based outside the AU. These companies have customers in the AUS and are subject to the same data protection <br>
        laws as me. Sometimes I might need to provide your information to a third party as required by AU law, or if I change a service provider.
        <br>
        <br>
        I may ask you for your consent to recommend you for work to a third party. I will explicitly ask for your consent before providing your contact details and you can choose what I provide. I will never provide your data without asking.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Public sharing of your name</h3>
        I may share your name publicly on my website to credit your work on a project. I will never share any information other <br>
        than your name. This information is collected and shared as part of my legitimate interest to market my work and credit you for yours.<br>
        If you don’t wish me to use your name to credit your work, you may object to my legitimate interests by contacting me.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <h3>How long I keep your data</h3>
        Data is retained for the length of the project, 5 years from the last contact we’ve had or as long as required to maintain business records.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Your rights</h3>
        You have the right to:<br>
        – Be informed about how I use your data<br>
        – Have access to your data<br>
        – Correct information I hold about you<br>
        – Ask for information I hold about you to be deleted or it’s use to be limited. I can’t delete your information<br>
        if keeping it is required to be kept under AU law. <br>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        Security of your information is important. I do what I can to secure your information. Some services (like email) <br>
        are not secure once they have left my computer. However, I do what I can to improve the security of your data. <br>
        I use the following:<br>
        – A VPN to encrypt traffic on public or shared WIFI connections<br>
        – Encrypted Drives<br>
        – Remote wiping of portable devices if lost<br>
        – Strong passwords and factor-two authentication wherever possible.<br>
        
        <br>
        <br>
